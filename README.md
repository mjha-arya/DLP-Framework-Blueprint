## üìñ Overview  
This repository contains the **‚ÄúDLP Blueprint‚Äù** deck, which outlines a structured approach for designing, implementing, and managing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) strategies for an organization. The guide serves as a reference for security teams, consultants, and architects undertaking DLP-focused engagements.

## üìÇ Repository Contents  


- **DLP-Blueprint.pptx**  
  The PowerPoint presentation covers:

  1. **Introduction & Objectives**  
     - Purpose and scope of DLP engagements  
     - Key stakeholder questions for discovery

  2. **Discovery Phase**  
     - Stakeholder workshop questions (critical data sources, threat vectors, existing policies)  
     - Documentation requests (network diagrams, current DLP rules/policies)

  3. **DLP Lifecycle & Data Flow**  
     - Mapping current and target DLP lifecycles (alerting, triage, response, post-event analysis)  
     - Data flow diagrams to identify risk points in data movement  

  4. **Framework & Methodology**  
     - Use-case identification methodology (exfiltration points, threat vectors, sensitive data types)  
     - Examples of MITRE ATT&CK techniques (e.g., T1048, T1190)  
     - Sample queries for data discovery using Defender (KQL for recent file events)

  5. **Use Cases**  
     - Inventory of existing DLP use cases and gap analysis  
     - Developing new use cases (baseline parameters, volumetric thresholds, threat vectors)  
     - Detailed templates for use-case implementation and results analysis  

  6. **Classification & Labelling**  
     - Importance of data classification and labelling in DLP  
     - Sample tables for classification practices and mitigation strategies  

  7. **Appendix**  
     - Supporting reference materials and disclaimers
